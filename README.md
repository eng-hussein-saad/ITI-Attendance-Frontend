## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (LTS version recommended)
*   Bun (preferred, as `bun.lockb` exists) or npm/yarn
*   Access to the backend API service.

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd ITI-Attendance-Frontend
    ```
2.  Install dependencies (using Bun is recommended):
    ```bash
    bun install
    ```
    Alternatively, use npm or yarn:
    ```bash
     npm install
     yarn install
    ```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the necessary environment variables. Based on the code, you'll likely need:

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=<your_backend_api_base_url>
# Example: VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/api/v1/

# Add other variables if needed (e.g., Cloudinary keys)
# VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=<your_cloudinary_cloud_name>
# VITE_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=<your_cloudinary_upload_preset>
```

Replace `<your_backend_api_base_url>` with the actual URL where the backend API is running.

### Running the Development Server

```bash
bun run dev
```

Or using npm/yarn:

```bash
npm run dev
yarn dev
```

This will start the Vite development server, typically at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Building for Production

```bash
bun run build
```

Or using npm/yarn:

```bash
npm run build
yarn build
```

This command bundles the application into the `dist` directory for deployment. The `Dockerfile` and `nginx.conf` suggest potential deployment using Docker and Nginx.
